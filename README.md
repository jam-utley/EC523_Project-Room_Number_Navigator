# EC523_Project-Room_Number_Navigator
This is a  project done for Boston University, EC523.

We are making a VLM real-time object tracker and analyzer. 
For faster real time processing, we are using yolov7 as a real-time object tracker that isolates the image and then sends the clipped into the VLM for analysis and location marking.
